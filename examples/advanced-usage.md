# Advanced Usage Examples

## Complex Project Breakdown

### Example 1: Complete Microservices Architecture
```
@TheOpenProducerBot

Design and implement a complete microservices architecture for our e-commerce platform:
- User service (authentication, profiles, preferences)
- Product service (catalog, inventory, search)
- Order service (cart, checkout, payment processing)
- Notification service (email, SMS, push notifications)
- Analytics service (user behavior, sales metrics, reporting)

Each service should be independently deployable with its own database.
Include API gateway, service discovery, and inter-service communication patterns.

labels: architecture, microservices, backend
components_list: user-service, product-service, order-service, notification-service, analytics-service, api-gateway
```

**Expected Result:** The bot will create 15-20 issues covering:
- Service design and architecture
- Database design for each service
- API implementation
- Service communication
- Deployment and infrastructure
- Testing and monitoring

### Example 2: Mobile App Development
```
@TheOpenProducerBot

Build a cross-platform mobile application for task management:
- Native iOS and Android apps
- Real-time synchronization with backend
- Offline functionality
- Push notifications
- User authentication and profiles
- Team collaboration features
- File attachments and sharing
- Analytics and reporting

Technology stack: React Native, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL, Redis.

## Configuration Examples

### Example 8: Custom Deduplication Strategy
```
@TheOpenProducerBot

template: Create API documentation for all existing endpoints
Include request/response examples, error codes, and authentication details.

count: 8
labels: documentation, api
unique_by: title
rate_limit_per_minute: 10
```

### Example 9: High-Volume Issue Generation
```
@TheOpenProducerBot

template: Comprehensive testing suite for payment processing system
Include unit tests, integration tests, and E2E scenarios for all payment methods.

count: 15
labels: testing, quality-assurance, payments
components_list: unit-tests, integration-tests, e2e-tests, mock-services, test-data
rate_limit_per_minute: 5
```

### Example 10: Multi-Project Coordination
```
@TheOpenProducerBot

Coordinate development across multiple repositories:
- Frontend application (React)
- Backend API (Node.js)
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Admin dashboard (Vue.js)

## Best Practices

### Tips for Effective Results:

1. **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed requirements
2. **Context Matters**: Include relevant technical constraints
3. **Use Components**: Break down complex systems into logical components
4. **Set Limits**: Use `count` parameter for very large projects
5. **Dry Run First**: Preview complex breakdowns before execution
6. **Label Appropriately**: Use meaningful labels for organization
7. **Consider Deduplication**: Use `unique_by` to prevent duplicate issues

### When to Use Different Approaches:

- **Simple tasks**: Let AI determine count automatically
- **Complex projects**: Specify count and components
- **Uncertain requirements**: Use dry run mode first
- **Recurring tasks**: Set specific deduplication strategy
- **Team coordination**: Use detailed templates and components
